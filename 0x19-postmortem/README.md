Postmortem: Web Stack Outage Incident

Issue Summary:

Duration:
Start Time: January 16, 2024, 14:30 UTC
End Time: January 16, 2024, 17:45 UTC
Impact:
The outage affected the core functionality of our e-commerce platform, resulting in a 30% degradation in website performance and intermittent service interruptions for users attempting to make purchases.
Timeline:

Detection:

14:30 UTC - Issue detected through automated monitoring alerts indicating a spike in latency and increased error rates on critical API endpoints.
14:35 UTC - Engineers received automated alerts and began investigating.
Actions Taken:

14:40 UTC - Initial assumption that the issue might be related to increased traffic due to ongoing promotions.
14:50 UTC - Investigated network infrastructure for potential bottlenecks, but no anomalies found.
15:05 UTC - Customer support reported a surge in user complaints about checkout failures.
15:10 UTC - Focused investigation on the payment processing system due to the critical nature of checkout failures.
15:30 UTC - Misleading assumption that a recent code deployment might have introduced a bug in the payment processing logic.
Escalation:

15:45 UTC - Incident escalated to the DevOps team for further analysis and to involve relevant backend developers.
16:00 UTC - Cross-functional meeting held with representatives from DevOps, Backend, and QA teams to collaboratively diagnose the issue.
Resolution:

17:15 UTC - Root cause identified: A misconfiguration in the load balancer leading to uneven distribution of traffic among payment processing servers.
17:30 UTC - Load balancer configuration corrected to evenly distribute traffic and alleviate the strain on specific servers.
17:45 UTC - Full system recovery; website performance restored to normal levels.
Root Cause and Resolution:

Root Cause:
The primary issue stemmed from a misconfiguration in the load balancer, causing uneven distribution of traffic and overloading specific payment processing servers.
Resolution:
Load balancer configuration was corrected to evenly distribute traffic among payment processing servers, resolving the performance degradation and intermittent service interruptions.
Corrective and Preventative Measures:

Improvements/Fixes:

Enhance load balancing configuration checks and implement automated alerts for any anomalies in traffic distribution.
Conduct thorough testing and validation of load balancer configurations before and after deployments.
Improve communication channels between monitoring systems, customer support, and engineering teams to expedite issue resolution.
Tasks:

Task 1: Implement additional monitoring for key API endpoints, focusing on latency and error rates.
Task 2: Conduct a comprehensive review of load balancer configurations for all critical services.
Task 3: Schedule regular load testing scenarios to identify potential performance bottlenecks.
Task 4: Establish a post-incident review process to analyze and document lessons learned for continuous improvement.
